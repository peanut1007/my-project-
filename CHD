1. Coronary Heart Disease
  simulation model that consists of three sub models:
    Demographic Epidemiologic Submodel, the Bridge Submodel, and the Disease History submodel
    
    i) assesses each individual's risk of develping CHD based on age, sex, smoking status, diastolic blood pressure, relatvie weight, serum cholesterol level.
      -- 50 years follow up
      
    ii) Bridge su model charaterizes subjects for the first 30 day afterthey develop CHD, considered all events/interventions such as bypass surgery, recurrent CHD events, CHD deaths, and deaths from other causes

2. Risk Factor interventions

  reductins in diastolic blood pressure.
  sensitivity analyses on each intervention. determine how change in factor gains life expectancy.
